Jackson Gabbard is a Facebook engineer I know from a [ROSEdu](http://techblog.rosedu.org/facebook-hackathon-live-blogging.html) hackathon where I was part of the organization team. He has now started a [series](http://jg.gg/category/unqualified-engineer/) of videos, where he shares some thoughtful ideas about programming interviews in a really hilarious way.
