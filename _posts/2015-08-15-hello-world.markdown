I've started preparing for my upcoming interviews this fall. On this blog I'll
write more about the problems I've solved, books I've used and other tips and
tricks.

# Background experience
* been three times to the National Olympiad. Best result was 20th place
* CompSci student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science in Bucharest
* I love web development and have some open source projects on
[Github](https://github.com/palcu)
* worked almost 2 years for a startup named uberVU and for Hootsuite, the bigger
company that acquired us

# The plan for this year
* finish the cracking the code interview
* code lots of problems on LeetCode and HackerRank
* take as many interviews as possible

Even though I love Python more, I'm more profficient with solving algorithm
problems in C++, partly because at the Olympiad it was the only sane language
to use.

Finally, I bought myself a whiteboard to motivate me.
