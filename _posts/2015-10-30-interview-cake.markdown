I saw this [guide][0] for taking interviews on Hacker News. I immediately recognized Interview Cake, because I had solved some free problems for it. The article convinced me to buy a subscription.

It's a good investment, because now I have something to work on in the metro while I commute. Also, most of the problems can be submitted on LeetCode, so I get to test my implementation skills.
