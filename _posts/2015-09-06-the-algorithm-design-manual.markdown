While I was re-reading Steve Yegge's [post][0] about getting that job at
Google, I stumbled upon two great pieces of advice. The first one was to bring
your own thin markers, because your density of code on the whiteboard will be
bigger.

The second one was to start reading Steven Skiena's book, The Algorithm Design
Manual. So, in the bus on my trip from my hometown to Bucharest, I started
lecturing it, without solving the problems. More like a story book.

I think I like it more than CTCI because the code is in C++ and there is a
bigger focus on implementations.
