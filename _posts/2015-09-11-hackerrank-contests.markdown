Yesterday I found out a cute contest on HackerRank called Magic Lines. I had to
replace a single line of code in 7 problems. Some problems were easy and the
code was straightforward, while others were seemingly written with the feet.
[Check out them][0].

Also, the [HackerRank World Cup][1] is starting today. Good luck to everyone!
