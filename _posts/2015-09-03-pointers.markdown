I've always messed up the `*` and `&` symbols in C++. I never fully understood
what a pointer is and how it works.

Till I found this article on
[cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/). Another think
that is in my reading list is the book [Understanding and Using C
Pointers](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028000.do)
