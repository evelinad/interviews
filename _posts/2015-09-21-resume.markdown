To apply at a big company, you first need a resume. Which is a pretty different
monster than a Curriculum Vitae. I first read the chapter in Cracking The Coding
Interview to get some tips. I downloaded their [format][6], took some information
from my [LinkedIn][0] profile and added some [Github][1] projects. It looked
like [this](/assets/files/resume.pdf).

I gave it to one of my friends and the feedback was all negative. His most
important point was _"dude, I don't know what are your strengths"_. After some
more fiddling with every line of it, I arrived at the second [version][2].

Finally, another friend comes and says that I must get all the information in
just a single page. So, I trim most of the unnecessary stuff and arrive at my
[last version][3].

As layout and typography tips, I've used only two columns and everything is
Helvetica. I've also cut from the margins so that everything can fit in a single
page. Bolding keywords has also recommended because HR people scan only for
them.

For content, I've moved the awards section to be in the second place because
everybody told me that it's the best, even though they are not really top notch.
I've also dropped the other 2 projects I did in my high-school years, and only
focused on a single one I've finished this summer. [Theodor][4] also recommended
me this [good][5] article.

Finally, you will get friends that tell you to remove the education section
altogether and friends who say you should add courses you've done in university.
Just go with your guts when conflicting opinions appear.
