Like a [towel][1] is the most important item a Hitchhiker should carry, a rubber
duck should be in the backpack of any programmer.

> Rubber duck debugging is an informal term used in software engineering for a
> method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The
> Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck
> and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the
> duck.

[_Wikipedia_][2]

I always forget that this is the best debugging method around.
