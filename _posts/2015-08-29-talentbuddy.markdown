In the last 2 days I've been solving problems on [TalentBuddy][1]. I love the
fact that problems are structured in tracks like elementary data structures,
math, search, graph or even challenges by companies like Google or Uber.

Another thing that I like is the fact that after solving a problem, I can see
solutions by other people. The website was built by Romanian entrepreneurs, so I
usually find code written by my friends.
