I decided that my mobile headphones were not suitable for a phone interview, so I began researching on the internet for better ones. Luckly, I know [The Wirecutter][wirecutter] for quite some time and I've always trusted their reviews for my purchase decisions.

The [Microsoft LifeChat LX-6000][microsoft] was their recommendation for the [Best USB Office Headset][wirecutter2]. I found it on [a local website][emag] in Romania and bought it. A little overpriced though.

As far as using it, I'm pretty really happy with it's microphone noise cancelation feature and with the sound.
