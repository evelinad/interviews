A friend of mine has some problems with the Introduction to Databases subject at
his university. Quoting Doru Ila»ôi, another friend who is a DBA, _"what fucking app does not
use a database these days"_, I wholeheartedly recommend you to learn what
databases are, how they work and what are the models behind them, and leave
alone the "Learn SQL in 3 days" approach.

My first recommendation is the [Introduction to Databases][0] MOOC from Stanford,
taught by Jennifer Widom. It's the only one I've seen where you learn about
relational algebra. There is even a [self-paced][1] version where you can study
only the chapters you are interested. I've finished the original course back in
2011 and that was the moment when I started to understand them more thoroughly.

If you don't have enough time to dive into a large MOOC, Khan Academy has
released a [course][2] on SQL this year. I don't know the quality, but people
seem to praise it on [this][3] Hacker News thread.

For those who just need some simple SQL syntax exercises, I recommend
[sqlteaching.com][4] and [sqlbolt.com][5]. They make you do a range of tasks
that start easily and then later become harder, while writing the commands in your
browser.

Finally, if you start preparing for interviews, [LeetCode][6] and
[HackerRank][7] have a small set of problems, but with some of them being really
challenging.
